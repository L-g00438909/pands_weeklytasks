**Weekly Tasks 02**
***
Write a program called bank.py 

The program should:

Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
Add the two amounts
Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 

**Weekly Tasks 03**
***
Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs)

Extra:
Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)

**Weekly Tasks 04**
***
Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

Have the program end if the current value is one.


**Weekly Tasks 05**
***
Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. (The program should be called weekday.py)
An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.

$ python weekday.py

Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.


An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:

$ python weekday.py

It is the weekend, yay!

**Weekly Task 06**
***

Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.


**Weekly Task 07**
***
Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. 

The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. 

**Weekly Task 08**

Write a program called plottask.py that displays:

a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, 
on the one set of axes.
